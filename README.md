# 🌐 JavaScript Practice & DOM Exploration

This is a personal project where I explored the fundamentals of JavaScript and started working with the DOM. It began as a collection of small experiments and evolved into a space to understand how JavaScript really works — from basic syntax to browser interaction.

## 🎯 About the Project

This project helped me build confidence writing JavaScript by hand: working with strings, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions — and later moving into object-oriented concepts and dynamic interfaces using the DOM.

I used simple HTML and CSS to support the JS logic, and experimented with tools like Gulp and Node.js to automate and organize the workflow.
